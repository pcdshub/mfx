Collection of Bluesky plans for collecting attenuator scans with the DAQ.

Functions
---------
attenuator_scan_multi_run()
    Collect multiple DAQ runs, each at a different transmission level, set by
    the attenuator configuration.
attenuator_scan_single_run()
    Collect a single DAQ run while varying the transmission level through the
    attenuator configuration.
