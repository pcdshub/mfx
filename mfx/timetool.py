    Determine whether a specific detected edge on the timetool camera is "good"

    Good/bad is defined by whether the timetool data shows the detected edge

    Automate the correction of timing drift. Will adjust the stages to
    center the timetool edge on the camera and compensate the laser delay to
    maintain the desired nominal time point. Runs in an infinite loop.

    Parameters
    ----------
    amplitude_thresh : float, optional
        The minimum amplitude of the fitted timetool peak to include the
        data point in the rolling average used for drift correction.
        Default: 0.02.
    ipm_thresh : float, optional
        The minimum ipm DG2 value to perform drift correction. Setting a
        reasonable value prevents attempts at drift correction when X-rays
        are very weak or down. Default: 500.
    drift_adjustment_thresh : float, optional
        The minimum drift value to correct for in picoseconds. E.g. a value
        of 0.05 means any time the rolling average finds that the timetool
        center is off by 50 fs in either direction it will compensate. Default:
        0.05 ps.
    fwhm_threshs : Tuple[float, float], optional
        Minimum and maximum FWHM from the processed timetool signal to consider
        a measurement to be "good."
    num_events : int, optional
        The number of "good" timetool edge measurements to include in the
        rolling average. Ideally a prime number to remove effects from
        sytematic errors. Default 61 measurements.

        Log timing corrections to a file.
